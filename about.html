              ><a href="./">WINGS</a> is a semantic workflow system</strong
            >
            that assists scientists with the design of computational
            experiments. A computational experiment specifies how selected
            datasets are to be processed by a series of software components in a
            particular configuration. Earth scientists use computational
            experiments to estimate seismic hazard through simulations of
            earthquake forecasts. Biologists use computational experiments for
            analysis of gene expression microarray data or molecular interaction
            networks and pathways. Social scientists analyze large social
            networks to discover structural regularities based on mining
            relations among individuals.

          <p>
            <strong
              >A unique feature of <a href="./">WINGS</a> is that its workflow
              representations incorporate semantic constraints</strong
            >
            about datasets and workflow components.
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> reasons about dataset properties and
            component constraints to create and validate workflows and to
            generate metadata for new data products. <a href="./">WINGS</a> uses
            <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> or
            <a href="http://oodt.apache.org">OODT</a> as the execution engine
            for large-scale distributed workflow execution. A high-level diagram
            of architecture of <a href="./">WINGS</a> is shown here:
          </p>
          <p><img src="images/Architecture-Color.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            <strong
              ><a href="./">WINGS</a> allows users to express high-level
              descriptions of their analysis goals,</strong
            >
            and assists them by automatically and systematically generating
            possible workflows that are consistent with that request. A
            high-level user request is one that only partially specifies what
            datasets, parameters, or software components are to be used. Users
            can be assisted in an interactive mode, where
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> generates suggestions and validates their
            inputs, or in an automatic mode, where <a href="./">WINGS</a> can
            elaborate their initial request and present the user with
            execution-ready workflows as options.
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> generates workflows in three-stages search
            process. First it selects components for each step in the workflow.
            Then it selects datasets from the catalogs to elaborate the initial
            workflow request and its template. Finally it configures the
            parameters for each component in the workflow. During the search
            process, <a href="./">WINGS</a> eliminates workflow candidates that
            are not viable because they contain invalid combinations of choices.
            Once a workflow candidate is fully elaborated,
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> expands the workflow to specify any parallel
            computations over dataset collections. For all the new data
            products, it generates metadata attributes by propagating metadata
            from the input data through the descriptions and constraints
            specified for each of the components. The entire workflow creation
            and generation process is annotated in detail in a provenance
            catalog for later inspection.

            <strong
              ><a href="./">WINGS</a> is built on open web standards</strong
            >
            from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) such as the Web Ontology
            Language (OWL), the Resource Description Framework (RDF), and the
            SPARQL query language for RDF. The core ontologies are defined in
            OWL, while workflow templates, requests, and candidates are
            expressed in RDF. Many constraints are represented as RDF triples,
            others that are more complex are represented via Jena Rules.

            <strong
              >The <a href="./">WINGS</a> workflow system has an open modular
              design</strong
            >
            and can be easily integrated with other existing workflow systems
            and execution frameworks to extend them with semantic reasoning
            capabilities. We have integrated the Wings semantic workflow system
            with a variety of user interfaces, and submitted workflows with a
            variety of execution engines. <a href="./">WINGS</a> assumes
            external catalogs of software components and datasets that can be
            accessed through services. This is an important feature, since
            scientific environments consist of distributed services to access
            the data and algorithms necessary for data analysis. Many
            collaborations are set up where each institution may contribute
            resources (data, instruments, computers, software) by making them
            available to others while being maintained by the institution. Data
            providers may provide services to access data sources. There can be
            many organizations playing the role of data providers, and as a
            result data may be accessible in various catalogs that are in
            distributed remote locations. Other organizations may provide
            algorithms, services, models, or implemented codes that can process
            data and can be used as components of workflows. Each provider
            maintains the resources they contribute. Therefore, the
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> architecture is designed to interface with
            external data and component catalogs.

              ><a href="./">WINGS</a> provides a range of workflow execution
              alternatives.</strong
            >
            In cases where privacy or off-line use are important,
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> can submit workflows in a scripted format for
            execution in the local host. In cases where scale is important,
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> can submit workflows to Pegasus or OODT which
            will manage their execution in shared distributed resources in an
            efficient and scalable manner. Pegasus selects computational
            resources, optimizes the workflow structure, submits the workflow
            for execution, monitors its progress, and resolves possible
            failures. <a href="./">WINGS</a> has also been integrated with a
            variety of alternative execution engines, such as the System S
            engine for data stream processing and BPEL4WS engines.

              ><a href="./">WINGS</a> can be used as a web application without

            We offer a <a href="/sandbox">WINGS sandbox</a> where anyone can use
            <a href="./">WINGS</a> with a simple set of workflows that we have
            developed for tutorial purposes. The Wings Semantic Workflow
            Reasoner runs in the background, the user interface is the Wings Web
            Portal, and the execution is done by
            <a href="http://pegasus.isi.edu">Pegasus</a> or

            to newer versions) that contain workflows in diverse application
